# eleventy-Blog/\_includes

In Eleventy, the [includes directory](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/#directory-for-includes) is meant for reusable layouts and other extentions. Templates can use these files, but the files themselves will not be processed by Eleventy as templates.

The [`index.js`](https://github.com/andrewpap22/andreaspappas/blob/main/_includes/index.js) file here is used to configure modules in this directory with Eleventy (in [`.eleventy.js`](https://github.com/andrewpap22/andreaspappas/blob/main/.eleventy.js)).
