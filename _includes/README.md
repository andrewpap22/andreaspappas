# eleventy-dot-js-blog/\_includes

In Eleventy, the [includes directory](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/#directory-for-includes) is meant for reusable layouts and other extentions. Templates can use these files, but the files themselves will not be processed by Eleventy as templates.

The [`index.js`](https://gitlab.com/reubenlillie/eleventy-dot-js-blog/-/blob/master/_includes/index.js) file here is used to configure modules in this directory with Eleventy (in [`.eleventy.js`](https://gitlab.com/reubenlillie/eleventy-dot-js-blog/-/blob/master/.eleventy.js)).
